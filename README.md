## Task
The problem is to train and evaluate multiple classifiers on a given dataset, and the challenge the code tries to solve is to automate the process of training, evaluating, and comparing different machine learning models on the dataset.

## Description
The problem is solved by defining a function my_print_and_test_models that splits the dataset into training and validation sets, trains and evaluates multiple classifiers using cross-validation, and prints the evaluation results for each classifier.

## Installation
No installation is needed as the code can be run directly in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment with the required dependencies (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib).

## Usage
The code works by first loading the dataset from a given URL, then performing exploratory data analysis by printing the dataset shape, head, summary statistics, and class distribution. It then visualizes the dataset using histograms and scatter plots. Finally, it defines a function to train and evaluate multiple classifiers on the dataset using cross-validation and prints the evaluation results.

### The Core Team
I Olajuwon Aina and Winifred Chinenye Soligbo Fidelis works on the project.
